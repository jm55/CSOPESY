# CSOPESY - Introduction to Operating Systems
This Github repository will contain projects that are made for the course in CSOPESY.
## Projects
### MP1 - CPU Scheduling
The objective is to implement a simulation of basic CPU scheduling algorithms that conforms to the input-output format prescribed below. The basic CPU scheduling algorithms are:
1. First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
2. Shortest-Job First (SJF)
3. Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF)
4. Round-Robin (RR)
### MP2 - Process Scheduling
The objective is to implement the concepts and use of Semaphores, Monitors, and Locks in a threaded application.
